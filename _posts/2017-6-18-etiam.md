There are three major benchmarks in app prototyping. First is the proof of concept or POC. The second step is the minimum viable product, the MVP. And the last stage is the beta release.

The whole purpose of this process is to validate your idea and make sure you do not waste your time solving a problem that does not exist.

###  The POC 

Let's be honest in the web world you're most likely *NOT* building something for the first time. Someone else has already done something similar. At least from the view perspective. What you're hoping to offer is a new type of service or a new way of doing something. So trying to build a POC might, in all honesty, be a waste of time. You should be moving onto the MVP, building something people can actually start to use.

>  A POC makes perfect sense if you're integrating with IOT or some other type of external service or hardware that you're making. Something more than just a user interface(UI) that people are working with.
